#Question4
#Difference B/w a library and an API
API is a part of library which defines how an application communicates with external code.API can be written in any language.

Library is written in same language which is a collection of all the functionalities required for the use case.

For example : Numpy is a library of Python, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

We can create our own APIs using Python Framework like Django and Flask which can be used in websites.
You can follow documentation of Django in order to create your own website with Python. Check this out:
